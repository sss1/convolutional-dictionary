Implementation and experiments for a (theory) paper on covergence rates of convolutional sparse dictionary learning.

An early version of the full paper was presented at the proceedings of the 55th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing and is available [here](http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~sss1/publications/papers/singh_CSDL_Allerton17.pdf).

The three figures in the paper can be generated by running the files `experiment1.m`, `experiment2.m`, and `experiment3.m`, respectively, in the `reconstruction_synthetic_experiments` folder. Running any of these files runs the corresponding experiment and saves the results. The figures can then be generated using `plot_experiment1.m`, `plot_experiment2.m`, and `plot_experiment3.m`, respectively. The CSDL algorithm itself is implemented in `learn_constrained_sparse_dictionary.m`, and depends on `ProjectOntoL1Ball.m` (authored by John Duchi), `sptoeplitz.m` (authored by Tobin Driscoll), and `multiconv.m`.
