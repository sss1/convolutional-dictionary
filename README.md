# Convolutional Sparse Dictionary Learning
Implementation and experiments for an AISTATS 2018 (theory) paper on covergence rates of convolutional sparse dictionary learning. The paper can be found [here](http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~sss1/publications/papers/singh_CSDL_AISTATS17.pdf).

An early version of the full paper was presented at the proceedings of the 55th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing and is available [here](http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~sss1/publications/papers/singh_CSDL_Allerton17.pdf).

The figures in the paper can be generated by running the files `experiment1.m`, `experiment2.m`, `experiment2_correlated.m`, `experiment3.m`, and `experiment4.m`, respectively, in the `reconstruction_synthetic_experiments` folder. Running any of these files runs the corresponding experiment (which may take up to a few hours) and saves the results. The figures can then be generated using `plot_experiment1.m`, `plot_experiment2.m`, and `plot_experiment3.m`, respectively. The CSDL algorithm itself is implemented in `learn_constrained_sparse_dictionary.m`, and depends on `ProjectOntoL1Ball.m` (authored by John Duchi), `sptoeplitz.m` (authored by Tobin Driscoll), and `multiconv.m`.
